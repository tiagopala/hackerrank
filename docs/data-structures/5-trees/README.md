# Trees

## Binary Trees

A binary search tree has one of the **most efficient search algorithms** because it always searches for the middle number until it finds what you're looking for.

## Terminology

- `root`: First element of a tree.
- `leaf`: Non-root element with no children.
- `ancestor`: The parent of some element, located at left/right.
- `child`: The node below an ancestor.
- `depth` (level): It's the distance of some node (number of edges) to the root.
